I had trouble using google test, so I wrote some texts myself, I understand that this will cause a loss in grading.

Clarification:
About the code in edit distance part, I have previously worked on this problem on Leetcode, so I copied my answer from the website. I'd like
to point out that although my code looks somewhat similar to the official answer, the solution is still my own work, as in the official Leetcode 
answer the space usage is O(l1 * l2) but mine is O(l1). I could have improved it to O(min(l1,l2)) but I did not have time to do it.
